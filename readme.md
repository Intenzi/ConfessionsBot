## Info

This was a quick made bot for a friend's private server.
There was just no public confession bot that provided the features just as needed.

If you require any assistance in setting it up for your own server, or would like for me to customize it to your liking, send me a dm at `Intenzi#0069`.

I also freelance custom discord bots so if you have an idea you want to bring to life, I can help you with it 😁.
